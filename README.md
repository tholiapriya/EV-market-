EV Market Segmentation Based on Vehicle Type (India)

This project focuses on **segmenting the Indian EV market based on the type of vehicle purchased**, using demographic and income data from an automobile buying behavior dataset. The goal is to understand **which customer profiles prefer specific EV types**â€”such as sedans, SUVs, hatchbacksâ€”and how preferences vary by salary, family size, and other features.

 Vehicle Type Mapping

Mapped the `Make` column to general **vehicle categories**:

| Make          | Vehicle Type |
|---------------|--------------|
| Verna         | Sedan        |
| Nexon EV      | SUV          |
| Tiago EV      | Hatchback    |
| Tigor EV      | Sedan        |
| MG ZS EV      | SUV          |
| e2oPlus       | Hatchback    |
| ...           | ...          |

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **SUV buyers**: Typically 30â€“45 years old, high income, fewer dependents
- **Hatchback buyers**: Younger (20â€“30), budget-conscious, entry-level salary
- **Sedan buyers**: Moderate to high income, often salaried, low loan exposure
- **Price distribution**: SUVs are priced higher (â‚¹12â€“22L), hatchbacks lower (â‚¹6â€“10L)

 Correlation Highlights:
- **Total Salary** correlates strongly with **SUV ownership**
- **No. of Dependents** impacts preference: families prefer SUVs
- **Wife Working = Yes** correlates with mid-high vehicle price (dual income)

 Data Preprocessing

- Created `Vehicle Type` column from car `Make`
- Applied **Label Encoding** to: `Profession`, `Marital Status`, etc.
- Applied **Feature Scaling** using `StandardScaler` on numerical features

ðŸ“ˆ Clustering (KMeans)

Performed KMeans clustering on customer features based on vehicle type preference.

Optimal Clusters**: 3 (identified using Elbow Method)
  Cluster Summary**:

| Cluster | Dominant Vehicle Type | Buyer Profile                           |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0       | Hatchback              | Young, budget-conscious, first-time buyers |
| 1       | SUV                    | Families, high salary, urban professionals |
| 2       | Sedan                  | Professionals, average to high income      |
